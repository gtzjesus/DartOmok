The purpose of this assignment is to understand the concepts of
functional programming and have a taste of it in Dart [1].

In this assignment, you are to to write a Dart program for playing
omok games. Omok, meaning "five pieces", is a two-player strategy game
typically played with go pieces, black and white stones, on a go board
with 15x15 intersections (or places) [Wikipedia]. It can also be
played with a paper and pencils because stones, once placed, are not
allowed to be moved or removed from the board. The two players
alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection,
and the goal of the game is to place one's stones in a row of five
consecutive intersections vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The
winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones.
